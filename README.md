Each account saves; NBT data, advancements, and statistics. This mod is intended for use on roleplay servers, where players may want to act as multiple characters. It is activated by using the command "/account [account number]." <br>The mod has a config option that allows server owners to set a limit for the number of accounts a player can have, the default is 3. Each account creates a backup in the normal player saves folder under the format "[player uuid].[dat/json][account number - 1]." For example, "/account 1" will load "[your uuid].dat0."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px">Compatibility</span>: This mod is compatible with almost any mod, but may not switch certain player aspects. Anything else saved in the player NBT should work as expected.</p>
<p>this works with Apoli(<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins" rel="nofollow">origins</a>) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/drogtor" rel="nofollow">Drogtor the Nickinator</a>, but not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/styled-nicknames" rel="nofollow">Styled Nicknames</a>.<br>Please note that a mod being "not compatible" does not necessarily mean it will crash, it just will not change upon running the command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px">Note</span>: This mod alone will not affect your username. <br>You will also always disconnect upon running the command.<br><br><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Important Warning</strong>: <span style="font-size:14px">As this mod deals with sensitive files, it is strongly recommended to backup saves before use. </span></span><br><span style="font-size:14px">It is also not possible to use this mod on singleplayer or LAN worlds and it may cause harm. It is intended to be used on multiplayer servers only.</span></p>
